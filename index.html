      <h2>💡 10 Tips to Become a Better Young Entrepreneur</h2>

      <div class="tip-box" id="tip1">
        <p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Focus on building your network early. Meeting people who share your passion or can mentor you opens doors that textbooks cannot.</p>
        <button class="know-more-btn" onclick="toggleTip(event, 1)">🔍 Know more</button>
        <div class="expanded-content" id="tipContent1">
          <p>Building a strong professional network is critical. Start by attending local events, joining online forums, or connecting with alumni. Every contact you make can help you with advice, funding, or partnerships. Use social media like LinkedIn wisely, and don't hesitate to ask questions or seek guidance. Remember, networking is not just about taking but also giving back. Share your ideas and help others whenever possible to build trust and lasting relationships.</p>
          <p>Keep a contact list and follow up regularly. This continuous interaction will help you build meaningful connections. Over time, your network can become your biggest asset.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box" id="tip2">
        <p><strong>Tip 2:</strong> Set clear goals for your business, both short-term and long-term. Clarity helps you stay focused and measure your progress effectively.</p>
        <button class="know-more-btn" onclick="toggleTip(event, 2)">🔍 Know more</button>
        <div class="expanded-content" id="tipContent2">
          <p>Defining clear goals is essential to any entrepreneurial journey. Start by writing down what you want to achieve within the next 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year. Break these goals into actionable steps and prioritize them. When you have a clear direction, you avoid wasting time on distractions or unnecessary tasks.</p>
          <p>Also, keep reviewing and adjusting your goals as you learn more about your market and customers. Flexibility combined with clarity will help you succeed and grow sustainably.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box" id="tip3">
        <p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Understand your customers deeply. Knowing their needs, pain points, and desires allows you to tailor your products or services perfectly.</p>
        <button class="know-more-btn" onclick="toggleTip(event, 3)">🔍 Know more</button>
        <div class="expanded-content" id="tipContent3">
          <p>Customer understanding is at the heart of any successful business. Use surveys, interviews, or social media feedback to gather insights about your customers. What problems do they face? What motivates their buying decisions? The better you know them, the easier it is to create offerings that solve their problems.</p>
          <p>Don’t assume—you need real data and feedback. Always keep communication open, and be ready to pivot based on what your customers tell you. Happy customers become loyal advocates for your brand.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box" id="tip4">
        <p><strong>Tip 4:</strong> Manage your finances carefully. Track income and expenses from day one, and understand your cash flow to avoid surprises.</p>
        <button class="know-more-btn" onclick="toggleTip(event, 4)">🔍 Know more</button>
        <div class="expanded-content" id="tipContent4">
          <p>Financial discipline is key for startups. Even if your business is small, keep records of every transaction. Use simple spreadsheets or apps to track money coming in and going out. Understanding your cash flow helps you plan for expenses and investments.</p>
          <p>Make budgets and stick to them. Avoid unnecessary spending and always have a reserve for emergencies. Knowing your financial status will also help you when seeking loans or investors, as they want to see your financial awareness and planning skills.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box" id="tip5">
        <p><strong>Tip 5:</strong> Embrace failure as a learning tool. Every mistake teaches you something valuable and moves you closer to success.</p>
        <button class="know-more-btn" onclick="toggleTip(event, 5)">🔍 Know more</button>
        <div class="expanded-content" id="tipContent5">
          <p>No entrepreneur succeeds without setbacks. Instead of fearing failure, view it as an opportunity to improve. When things don’t go as planned, analyze what happened, learn from it, and adapt your strategy. This mindset builds resilience and creativity.</p>
          <p>Share your failures with mentors or peers to get feedback and encouragement. Remember, persistence and a positive attitude are often the difference between success and quitting too soon.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box" id="tip6">
        <p><strong>Tip 6:</strong> Stay curious and keep learning. The business world changes fast; ongoing learning keeps you competitive and innovative.</p>

        <div class="expanded-content" id="tipContent6">
          <p>Read books, watch videos, attend webinars, and follow industry news to stay updated. Learning new skills or tools can open unexpected doors. Technology, marketing trends, and customer behavior all evolve, and your knowledge must evolve too.</p>
          <p>Set aside time weekly for self-improvement. Join local entrepreneur groups or online communities to exchange ideas and experiences. Growth happens when you invest in yourself constantly.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box" id="tip7">

        <div class="expanded-content" id="tipContent7">
          <p>In today’s world, digital visibility is essential. Create social media profiles that reflect your brand values and engage authentically with followers. Post regularly, share behind-the-scenes content, and encourage feedback.</p>
          <p>A simple website or blog helps customers find you and learn more about your products or services. Use consistent branding and clear contact info. This builds trust and widens your market reach effectively.</p>
        </div>

          <p>Partnerships can be powerful. Look for complementary businesses or people who can help with skills or resources you lack. Collaboration can lead to joint marketing, product bundles, or shared knowledge.</p>
          <p>Choose partners carefully and ensure clear communication and shared goals. Together, you can tackle bigger challenges and create better products or services than alone.</p>
        </div>
